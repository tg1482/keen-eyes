    "summary": {
        "content": "The changes to the README.md file primarily streamline the installation instructions for the Keen Eyes tool. The 'Manual Installation' section heading has been removed, and the steps under this section have been slightly modified for clarity. The specific step of adding the Keen Eyes directory to the PATH variable has been removed, and it is now implied that the symlink will handle this. A potential PATH issue is addressed with a troubleshooting tip in place of specific instructions. The 'Homebrew Installation (Coming Soon)' section has been removed, and the 'Usage' section has been slightly updated to include instructions for accessing help documentation.",
        "importance": "high"
    },
    "strengths": {
        "content": "1. Clarity and Simplicity: The revised installation instructions are clearer and more direct, reducing the need for manual PATH adjustments (assuming the symlink works as expected). This could make the setup process easier, especially for less experienced users. \n2. Troubleshooting Tip: Providing a troubleshooting step for potential PATH issues can preempt common user frustrations and improve the overall user experience. \n3. Help Command: Encouraging the use of `keen-eyes --help` for further instructions makes the document cleaner and educates users on where to get more information.",
        "importance": "medium"
    },
    "improvements": {
        "content": "1. PATH Issues (Line 20-24): The reliance on the symlink working correctly in all environments could be reconsidered. Explicit instructions for adding Keen Eyes to the PATH might still be necessary for some systems. Including these instructions as an optional step could be beneficial. \n2. Symlink Permissions (Line 16-17): Address potential permission issues with creating symlinks in '/usr/local/bin', which might require superuser privileges that are not mentioned. Clarifying this in the instructions would be helpful. \n3. Removal of Homebrew Section (Line 26-29): The 'Homebrew Installation' section has been entirely removed, which might leave users who prefer this method without guidance. Even if currently unavailable, a placeholder indicating future support could maintain user interest and provide a perceived commitment to continuous improvements.",
        "importance": "high"
    },
    "security": {
        "content": "1. Symlink Security (Line 16-17): Clarify the security implications of creating symlinks in '/usr/local/bin'. Users should be made aware of potential issues if multiple users share the same environment. \n2. Installation Script Review: Ensure that the `setup.sh` script is secure, as it will be directly modifying the user's system. Providing audit or review recommendations could increase user trust.",
        "importance": "high"
    },
    "style": {
        "content": "1. Consistency in Documentation: Maintaining headers like 'Manual Installation' helps with navigation and organization within the README. Removing it might affect readability for users looking to quickly scan the document. Consider adding this back or ensuring clear sections with subheadings. \n2. Bash Commands Formatting: The command lines are consistently formatted using triple backticks, which aids readability.",
